512,Art and the Artist ,John F. Kennedy,"When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the areas of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his experience. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses. For art establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the touchstones of our judgement.

537,Art and the Artist ,Maurice Sendak,"Illustrations have as much to say as the text. The trick is to say the same thing, but in a different way.

Neither be cynical about love - for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world."

8297,Prayer ,Oswald Chambers,"Intercessory prayer for one who is sinning prevails. God says so! The will of the man prayed for does not come into question at all, he is connected with God by prayer, and prayer on the basis of the Redemption sets the connection working and God gives life."
8298,Prayer ,Talmud,He who prays for his neighbors will be heard for himself.
8299,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"We should say to God as we mingle with our dear ones each day, ""God, give them each Thy blessing. They need it, because they live with me, and I am very selfish and unwilling to sacrifice very much for them, although I do love them."""
8300,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"See to it, night and day, that you pray for your children. Then you will leave them a great legacy of answers to prayer, which will follow them all the days of their life.

8311,Prayer ,Anonymous,"God receives little thanks, even for his greatest gifts."
8312,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"It is not only blessed to give thanks; it is also of vital importance to our prayer life in general. If we have noted the Lord's answers to our prayers and thanked Him for what we have received of Him, then it becomes easier for us, and we get more courage, to pray for more."
8313,Prayer ,Soren Kierkegaard,To stand on one leg and prove God's existence is a very different thing from going down on one's knees and thanking him.
8314,Prayer ,Anonymous,Our thanks to God should always precede our requests.
8315,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"Jesus is moved to happiness every time He sees that you appreciate what He has done for you.

It brings joy to Jesus."
8316,Prayer ,Jayne Crook,The idea of thanking staff should mean giving them something that they would never buy for themselves.
8317,Prayer ,Andrew Murray,Let us thank God heartily as often as we pray that we have His Spirit in us to teach us to pray. Thanksgiving will draw our hearts out to God and keep us engaged with Him; it will take our attention from ourselves and give the Spirit room in our hearts.
8318,Prayer ,Bible,Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving.
8319,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"When we succeed in truly thanking God, we feel good at heart. The reason is that we have been created to give glory to God, now and for-evermore. And every time we do so, we feel that we are in harmony with His plans and purposes for our lives. Then we are truly in our element. That is why it is so blessed."

8325,Prayer ,William S. Plumer,We may as well not pray at all as offer our prayers in a lifeless manner.
8326,Prayer ,E. M. Bounds,"There is neither encouragement nor room in Bible religion for feeble desires, listless efforts, lazy attitudes; all must be strenuous, urgent, ardent. Flamed desires, impassioned, unwearied insistence delight heaven. God would have His children incorrigibly in earnest and persistently bold in their efforts. Heaven is too busy to listen to half-hearted prayers or to respond to pop-calls. Our whole being must be in our praying."
8327,Prayer ,E. M. Bounds,"It is only when the whole heart is gripped with the passion of prayer that the life-giving fire descends, for none but the earnest man gets access to the ear of God."
8328,Prayer ,E. M. Bounds,"To say prayers in a decent, delicate way is not heavy work. But to pray really, to pray till hell feels the ponderous stroke, to pray till the iron gates of difficulty are opened, till the mountains of obstacles are removed, till the mists are exhaled and the clouds are lifted, and the sunshine of a cloudless day brightens-this is hard work, but it is God's work, and man's best labor."
8329,Prayer ,E. M. Bounds,"Importunity is a condition of prayer. We are to press the matter, not with vain repetitions, but with urgent repetitions. We repeat, not to count the times, but to gain the prayer. We cannot quit praying because heart and soul are in it. We pray ""with all perseverance."" We hang to our prayers because by them we live. We press our pleas because we must have them, or die."

8338,Prayer ,Anonymous,"Productive prayer requires earnestness, not eloquence."
8339,Prayer ,E. M. Bounds,Jesus taught that perseverance is the essential element of prayer. Men must be in earnest when they kneel at God's footstool. Too often we get faint-hearted and quit praying at the point where we ought to begin. We let go at the very point where we should hold on strongest. Our prayers are weak because they are not impassioned by an unfailing and resistless will.
8340,Prayer ,Margaret Gibb,"We must move from asking God to take care of the things that are breaking our hearts, to praying about the things that are breaking His heart."

8346,Prayer ,James Merrick,"Not what we wish, but what we need, Oh! let your grace supply, The good unasked, in mercy grant; The ill, though asked, deny."
8347,Prayer ,Juvenal,We should pray for a sane mind in a sound body.
8348,Prayer ,Dietrich Bonhoeffer,"If we are to pray aright, perhaps it is quite necessary that we pray contrary to our own heart. Not what we want to pray is important, but what God wants us to pray. The richness of the Word of God ought to determine our prayer, not the poverty of our heart."

8359,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"Pray a little each day in a childlike way for the Spirit of prayer.

There is nothing He would rather do than unveil to you the grace of prayer."
8360,Prayer ,Oswald Chambers,"God does not exist to answer our prayers, but by our prayers we come to discern the mind of God."

8363,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"When we in prayer seek only the glorification of the name of God, then we are in complete harmony with the spirit of prayer. Then our hearts are at rest both while we pray and after we have prayed. Then we can wait for the Lord."
8364,Prayer ,Saint Francis of Assisi,Grant that we may not so much seek to be understood as to understand.
8365,Prayer ,Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,"Grant me the courage not to give up, even though I think it is hopeless."

8373,Prayer ,E. M. Bounds,"The possibilities of prayer are found in its allying itself with the purposes of God, for God's purposes and man's praying are the combination of all potent and omnipotent forces."
8374,Prayer ,Bible,"If we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us."
8375,Prayer ,Francois de Fenelon,I would have no desire other than to accomplish thy will. Teach me to pray; pray thyself in me.

8377,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"Do not forget that prayer is ordained for the purpose of glorifying the name of God. Therefore, whether you pray for big things or for little things, say to God, ""If it will glorify Thy name, then grant my prayer and help me."""

8386,Prayer ,C. S. Lewis,It is quite useless knocking at the door of heaven for earthly comfort. It's not the sort of comfort they supply there.
8387,Prayer ,Theodore Roosevelt,"Pray not for lighter burdens, but for stronger backs."
8388,Prayer ,Henry Ward Beecher,"Prayer covers the whole of man's life. There is no thought, feeling, yearning, or desire, however low, trifling, or vulgar we may deem it, which if it affects our real interest or happiness, we may not lay before God and be sure of sympathy. His nature is such that our often coming does not tire him. The whole burden of the whole life of every man may be rolled on to God and not weary him, though it has wearied man."
8389,Prayer ,Joseph Scriven,"What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and griefs to bear! What a privilege to carry Everything to God in Prayer! Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer. Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care? Precious Savior, still our refuge, Take it to the Lord in prayer. O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear, All because we do not carry Everything to God in prayer!"

8400,Prayer ,Andrew Murray,"Do not strive in your own strength; cast yourself at the feet of the Lord Jesus, and wait upon Him in the sure confidence that He is with you, and works in you.

8401,Prayer ,O. Hallesby,"A humble and contrite heart knows that it can merit nothing before God, and that all that is necessary is to be reconciled to one's helplessness and let our holy and almighty God care for us, just as an infant surrenders himself to his mother's care."

8406,Prayer ,Dwight D. Eisenhower,"This is what I found out about religion: It gives you courage to make decisions you must make in a crisis, and then the confidence to leave the result to a Higher Power. Only by trust in God can a man carrying responsibility find repose."

8440,Prayer ,Oswald Chambers,"Prayer is often a temptation to bank on a miracle of God instead of on a moral issue, i.e., it is much easier to ask God to do my work than it is to do it myself. Until we are disciplined properly, we will always be inclined to bank on God's miracles and refuse to do the moral thing ourselves. It is our job, and it will never be done unless we do it."

8452,Prayer ,E. M. Bounds,"I think Christians fail so often to get answers to their prayers because they do not wait long enough on God.

8453,Prayer ,William Temple,"When I pray, coincidences happen, and when I don't, they don't."

Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. . . . Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world."

23410,Writers and Writing ,William Stafford,I am not learning definitions as established in even the latest dictionaries. I am not a dictionary-maker. I am a person a dictionary-maker has to contend with. I am a living evidence in the development of language.
23411,Writers and Writing ,William Stafford,I have this feeling of wending my way or plundering through a mysterious jungle of possibilities when I am writing. This jungle has not been explored by previous writers. It never will be explored. It's endlessly varying as we progress through the experience of time. These words that occur to me come out of my relation to the language which is developing even as I am using it.

23433,Writers and Writing ,Lewis Carroll,Take care of the sense and the sounds will take of care themselves.
23434,Writers and Writing ,Saul Bellow,"There is today an extraordinary interest with the data of modern experience per se. Our absorption in our contemporary historical state is very high right now. It's not altogether unlike a similar situation in seventeenth century Holland, where wealthy merchants wanted their portraits done with all their blemishes included. It is the height of egotism, in a sense, to think even one's blemishes are of significance. So today Americans seem to want their writers to reveal all their weaknesses, their meannesses, to celebrate their very confusions. And they want it in the most direct possible way - they want it served up neat, as it were, without the filtering and generalizing power of fiction."
23435,Writers and Writing ,A. J. Liebling,"I can write better than anyone who can write faster, and I can write faster than anyone who can write better."

23443,Writers and Writing ,Robert Graves,"There should be two main objectives in ordinary prose writing: to convey a message and to include in it nothing that will distract the reader's attention or check his habitual pace of reading - he should feel that he is seated at ease in a taxi, not riding a temperamental horse through traffic."
23444,Writers and Writing ,George Woodcock,"If we try to envisage an 'average Canadian writer' we can see him living near a campus, teaching at least part-time at university level, mingling too much for his work's good with academics, doing as much writing as he can for the CBC, and always hoping for a Canada Council Fellowship."

23447,Writers and Writing ,Rumer Godden,For a dyed-in-the-wool author nothing is as dead as a book once it is written ... she is rather like a cat whose kittens have grown up. While they were a-growing she was passionately interested in them but now they seem hardly to belong to her - and probably she is involved with another batch of kittens as I am involved with other writing.

23458,Writers and Writing ,Theodore Isaac Rubin,"The process of writing a book is infinitely more important than the book that is completed as a result of the writing, let alone the success or failure that book may have after it is written . . . the book is merely a symbol of the writing. In writing the book, I am living. I am growing. I am tapping myself. I am changing. The process is the product."
23459,Writers and Writing ,Stephen Leacock,Writing is no trouble: you just jot down ideas as they occur to you. The jotting is simplicity itself- it is the occurring which is difficult.

23472,Writers and Writing ,Brian Moore,"When you're a writer, you no longer see things with the freshness of the normal person. There are always two figures that work inside you, and if you are at all intelligent you realize that you have lost something. But I think there has always been this dichotomy in a real writer. He wants to be terribly human, and he responds emotionally, but at the same time there's this cold observer who cannot cry."
23473,Writers and Writing ,Hilaire Belloc,"When I am dead, I hope it may be said: 'His sins were scarlet, but his books were read.'"
23474,Writers and Writing ,Samuel Johnson,"The best part of every author is in general to be found in his book, I assure you."

23478,Writers and Writing ,E. B. White,"Advice to young writers who want to get ahead without any annoying delays: don't write about Man, write about a man."
23479,Writers and Writing ,William Strunk,"Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell."

23499,Writers and Writing ,Mordecai Richler,"I work every day - or at least I force myself into office or room. I may get nothing done, but you don't earn bonuses without putting in time. Nothing may come for three months, but you don't earn the fourth without it."

23503,Writers and Writing ,John Hersey,Journalism allows it's readers to witness history. Fiction gives its readers an opportunity to live it.
23504,Writers and Writing ,Ernest Hemingway,"His (the writer's) standard of fidelity to the truth should be so high that his invention, out of his experience, should produce a truer account than anything factual can be."
23505,Writers and Writing ,J. B. Priestley,"The most lasting reputation I have is for an almost ferocious aggressiveness, when in fact I am amiable, indulgent, affectionate, shy and rather timid at heart."
23506,Writers and Writing ,Gabrielle Roy,"The life of a writer is tragic: the more we advance, the farther there is to go and the more there is to say, the less time there is to say it."
23507,Writers and Writing ,Nicola Chiaromonte,It is only through fiction and the dimension of the imaginary that we can learn something real about individual experience. Any other approach is bound to be general and abstract.

23521,Writers and Writing ,Anton Chekhov,"My own experience is that once a story has been written, one has to cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we authors do most of our lying . . . one must ruthlessly suppress everything that is not concerned with the subject. If, in the first chapter, you say there is a gun hanging on the wall, you should make quite sure that it is going to be used further on in the story."

23545,Writers and Writing ,Isaac Bashevis Singer,"Writing has power, but its power has no vector. Writers can stir the mind, but they can't direct it. Time changes things, God changes things, the dictators change things, but writers can't change anything."

23547,Writers and Writing ,Maxwell Perkins,"Anybody can find out if he is a writer. If he were a writer, when he tried to write of some particular day, he would find in the effort that he could recall exactly how the light fell and how the temperature felt, and all the quality of it. Most people cannot do it. If they can do it, they may never be successful in a pecuniary sense, but that ability is at the bottom of writing, I am sure."
23548,Writers and Writing ,Maxwell Perkins,"I believe the writer... should always be the final judge. I have always held to that position and have sometimes seen books hurt thereby, but at least as often helped. The book belongs to the author."
